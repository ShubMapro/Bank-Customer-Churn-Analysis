**Business Objective:**
The objective of this project is to perform a comprehensive churn analysis on bank customer data to identify patterns and reasons behind customer attrition. The goal is to gather actionable insights that can help the bank reduce churn, improve customer satisfaction, and enhance long-term customer retention.

**Introduction:**
In today's highly competitive banking sector, retaining customers is essential for sustained success. Churn analysis is a crucial technique used to understand customer attrition and its underlying causes. By examining customer data, we can identify patterns and trends that lead to customer departures. This understanding allows the bank to implement targeted strategies to enhance customer satisfaction and loyalty, ultimately reducing churn rates.
Customer churn refers to the percentage of customers a business loses over a specific period. For example, if a bank starts with 100 customers and loses 10 during the month, the churn rate for that period is 10%.
